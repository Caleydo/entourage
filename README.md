==================

Caleydo Entourage is a visualization technique to efficiently perform multi-pathway analysis as it is often important to see relationships that are not included in the pathway. 

See the [project homepage](http://entourage.caleydo.org/) for further information.

A [demonstration](http://playground.caleydo.org/entourage/) is available in the Caleydo Playground.
